            <h2>Tic Tac Toe</h2>
            <p>You probably already know how to play Tic-Tac-Toe. It's a really simple game, right? That's what most
                people think. But if you really wrap your brain around it, you'll discover that Tic-Tac-Toe isn't
                quite as simple as you think!</p>
            <p>Tic-Tac -Toe (along with a lot of other games) involves looking ahead and trying to figure out what
                the person playing against you might do next.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>
                Rules for Tic-Tac-Toe
            </h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
                </li>
                <li>You are <span>X </span> , your friend is <span>O</span> . Players take turns putting their marks
                    in empty squares.</li>
                <li>The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
                </li>
                <li> all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a
                    tie.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>How can I win at Tic-Tac-Toe?</h2>
            <p>To beat the your friend (or at least tie), you need to make use of a little bit of strategy. Strategy
                means figuring out what you need to do to win</p>
            <p>Part of your strategy is trying to figure out how to get three X s in a row. The other part is trying
                to figure out how to stop the computer from getting three O s in a row.</p>
            <p>After you put an X in a square, you start looking ahead. Where's the best place for your next X ? You
                look at the empty squares and decide which ones are good choices which ones might let you make three
                X s in a row</p>
            <p>You also have to watch where the computer puts its O . That could change what you do next. If the
                computer gets two O s in a row, you have to put your next X in the last empty square in that row, or
                the computer will win. You are forced to play in a particular square or lose the game.</p>
            <p>If you always pay attention and look ahead, you'll never lose a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. You may not win,
                but at least you'll tie.</p>
